# OpenOrderReport

This **Power BI Report** provides an overview of all **Open Purchase Orders** in the system. The report allows you to slice the data based on **Vendor**, **Buyer**, and **Part ID**. It also includes custom buttons that leverage time intelligence to determine the status of each Purchase Order, whether it is **Late** or **Inbound**. Additionally, the report provides conditions to determine whether the items on the Purchase Order are currently in **IQC** (Incoming Quality Control).

### Last Refresh

By pointing the report to **[https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/New_York](https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/New_York)**, I am able to display the last time the data was refreshed when the report is using **Import Mode** to load the data.
